## Overview
PixelSpeak uses a combination of interactive lessons and games to help users learn languages. Once logged in, users can access a dashboard displaying their progress, leaderboard rankings, and options to select or change languages. The app dynamically generates language lessons using the Gemini API, providing a customized experience based on the user's selected language and proficiency level (beginner, intermediate, advanced). Users can then practice their vocabulary and language skills through the Asteroid Quiz Game, which tests their knowledge in a fun and engaging way. Successful completion of quizzes allows users to progress to the next proficiency level.

- **Multiple Languages**: Learn from a selection of languages with unique lessons.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Track progress, select languages, and view leaderboard standings.
- **Dynamic Lesson Generation**: Lessons and questions are created using the Gemini API, tailored to the user's language and proficiency level (beginner, intermediate, advanced).
- **Asteroid Quiz Game**: A mini-game designed to make vocabulary practice fun and engaging.
- **Level Progression**: Users can progress through different levels (beginner to intermediate to advanced) based on their performance in quizzes.

## Technologies Used
### Backend
- **Node.js & Express**: Server setup and API handling
- **MongoDB**: Database to store user information and progress
- **Cors**: Cross-origin resource sharing for client-server interactions

### Frontend
- **React**: Component-based UI for interactive learning experiences
- **React Router**: Navigation across various app pages
- **Context API**: State management for handling lessons and user data
- **Axios**: API calls to backend for lesson generation and user data retrieval

## Application Flow
1. **Login/Sign-Up**: Users begin by logging in or creating an account, gaining access to their unique dashboard.
2. **Dashboard**: Shows user‚Äôs progress, leaderboard ranking, and available languages.
3. **Language and Level Selection**: Clicking "Choose Language" directs users to a page where they select a language to learn and specify their proficiency level (beginner, intermediate, advanced).
4. **Lesson Generation**: Based on the chosen language and level, the frontend triggers a backend route (`/api/lessons/generate`), which uses the Gemini API to create relevant lessons.
5. **Learning and Gameplay**: Users engage with lessons and practice vocabulary through the Asteroid Quiz Game and other activities.
6. **Progression**: Upon successfully completing the game quiz, users advance to the next proficiency level (from beginner to intermediate, intermediate to advanced).

## Asteroid Quiz Game
The **Asteroid Quiz Game** is designed as a vocabulary practice module where users match words with their translations.

### How to Play:
1. **Start the Game**: Click the "Start Game" button.
2. **Match Words and Translations**: Asteroids with vocabulary words will descend from the top of the screen. Your task is to select the correct translation from the options before the asteroid reaches the bottom.
3. **Score Points**: Each correct answer earns points. The game increases in difficulty as your score rises, making it more challenging to keep up with new words.
4. **End of Game**: The game ends after a set time or when a certain number of asteroids reach the bottom without being answered.
5. **Level Progression**: Successful completion of the game quiz allows users to move to the next proficiency level (beginner to intermediate, intermediate to advanced).

### Controls
- **KeyW**: Move forward
- **KeyA**: Rotate left
- **KeyD**: Rotate right
- **Space**: Fire projectiles
